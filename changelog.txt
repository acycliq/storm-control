2017-07-26: Changed everything in the process of updating for Python3 and
            PyQt5. The entire configuration of a single setup is now
	    specified in a single XML file. See storm_control/hal4000/xml
	    for examples.

2016-02-23: Implement a (basic) parameters editor. This will make it easier
	    for users to change (most) of the parameters.

2016-01-19: Change HAL / Steve to use an absolute pixel size for each 
	    objective rather than a magnification relative to a 100x
	    objective.
	    
2016-01-06: Change the structure of the parameters in preparation for including
	    a parametor editor in HAL. The dot notation will now no longer work.
	    Simplify the parameters that are saved with a movie. These don't
	    need any type information, etc. as they are compared against the
	    default parameters. Move all the less commonly used parameters
	    into the appropriate module.

2015-12-09: Add pixel size metadata to .tif images in a form that ImageJ can
	    understand.

2015-10-09: Fix a recently introduced bug in the Andor EMCCD control software
            that caused it to drop frames and generate an error message in
	    the updateImageWithFrame member of the QCameraWidget class. If
	    you pulled a version in the last month and you use an Andor
	    EMCCD camera an update is recommended.

2015-09-24: Switched to doing all the image manipulation (for image display)
	    in C, falling back to numpy of the C library is not available.
	    
2015-09-21: Implemented camera feeds and cleaned up some of the camera related
	    stuff. At least in theory you can now do things like have multiple
	    displays of the frames from a single camera. You can also display
	    and/or capture average images and images at certain intervals, along
	    with a slice from a larger image. As part of this effort, camera
	    acquisition has been separated from camera display. Hopefully this
	    also makes the camera code a little easier to understand.

	    NOTE! This involves some changes to the layout of the hardware.xml file.

2015-09-09: Implemented control of an Andor sCMOS camera using their SDK3 library.
